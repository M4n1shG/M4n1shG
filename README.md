# Hi, I'm Manish Gupta 👋  

I work at the intersection of product, design, and engineering.  
My focus is on reimagining how people learn by building AI-powered digital experiences that are meaningful, intuitive, and human.

<br><br>

## What I Do  
- ⚙️ Serve as SVP Engineering at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, guiding AI-driven product development and engineering strategy.  
- 🏗️ Architect learning platforms, interactive tools, and large-scale systems across K–12 and Higher Ed.  
- 🎨 Combine engineering depth with design sensibility to guide multidisciplinary teams with clarity and intent.  
- 🤖 Apply AI-first thinking to how products are imagined, designed, built, scaled, and evolved.

## What You’ll Find Here  
This GitHub is the making side of my work.  
It aligns with the spirit of the M-Verse Playground, which you can explore at  
**[m-verse.com/playground](https://m-verse.com/playground)**, where ideas gain meaning through building.

You can expect:  
- 🔍 Early explorations that begin as questions or concepts.  
- 🧩 Interaction patterns, system logic, and prototypes shaped through design-led engineering.  
- 🛠️ AI-assisted implementations that translate creative direction into interfaces, behaviors, and flows.  
- 📚 Experiments that explore new ways of learning, practicing, and understanding.  
- 🧵 Code and artifacts that document process as much as outcome, since clarity often emerges through making.

<br><br>

## How I Work  
- 🧠 Start from first principles to see problems clearly.  
- 🧭 Challenge assumptions and simplify without losing depth.  
- 🪶 Build systems that balance utility, empathy, and craft.  
- 🤝 Treat AI as a partner that amplifies intent.  
- 🔨 Let ideas take shape through creation, not speculation.
